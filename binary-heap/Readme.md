This folder provide an example of binary heap.

> A binary heap is a heap data structure that takes the form of a binary tree.[1]


## How is Binary Heap  represented?

  1. The root element is at array[0]

  2. Below shows indexes of the other nodes for the i<sup>th</sup> node, i.e. , array[i]

      - array[ ( i - 1 ) / 2 ] Returns the parent node

      - array[ ( i * 2 ) + 1 ] Returns left child node

      - array[ ( i * 2 ) + 2 ] Returns right child node
